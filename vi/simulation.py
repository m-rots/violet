"""Creating a new `Simulation` is as simple as adding two lines of code to a Python file:

```python
from vi import Config, Simulation
Simulation(Config()).run()
```

To add some agents to your simulation, you have two tools available to you:
1. `HeadlessSimulation.batch_spawn_agents`
2. `HeadlessSimulation.spawn_agent`

As a general rule, you should avoid calling `HeadlessSimulation.spawn_agent` in a loop
as it will load the images from disk multiple times.
Instead, you should call `HeadlessSimulation.batch_spawn_agents` with your desired agent count.
This will only load the images once and cheaply distribute them across the agents.

If you want to spice things up, you can also add obstacles and sites to your simulation:
- `HeadlessSimulation.spawn_obstacle`
- `HeadlessSimulation.spawn_site`

To customise your simulation, you can provide a `vi.config.Config` to the simulation's constructor.

```python
from vi import Agent, Config, Simulation

(
    Simulation(Config(duration=60 * 10, image_rotation=True))
    .batch_spawn_agents(100, Agent, ["examples/images/white.png"])
    .run()
)
```

Once you're finished setting up your experiment
and want to start researching different parameters,
then you probably don't want to open a window every time.
Violet refers to this as Headless Mode.

Headless Mode allows you to run your simulation a bit faster by not calling any rendering-related code.
To activate Headless Mode, simply swap `Simulation` for `HeadlessSimulation` and your GPU should now remain idle!

    Headless Mode removes all the rendering logic from the simulation
    to not only remove the annoying simulation window from popping up every time,

    Combining Headless Mode with `vi.config.Matrix` and Python's [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) opens a realm of new possibilities.
    Vi's Matrix is `vi.config.Config` on steroids.
    It allows you to pass lists of values instead of single values on supported parameters,
    to then effortlessly combine each unique combination of values into its own `vi.config.Config`.
