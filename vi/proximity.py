    """The `ProximityIter` is a small wrapper around a *generator* of agents that are in proximity.

    Now, you've probably never heard of a generator before, so let me give you the TLDR.
    A Python generator is basically a stream of values. In our case, agents!

    By not adding the agents in a list or in a set, but keeping them in a stream,
    we can add multiple filters while keeping amazing performance.

    When we're done with the filtering, we can either `count` the agents in our stream
    (thereby consuming the stream, it's single-use only) or we can collect them in a list or a set.

    Examples
    --------

    Imagine that our agent is Mudusa. We want to freeze the movement of all agents that we see.

    We can implement this by simply looping over all the agents that are returned in the `ProximityIter` stream.

    >>> class Medusa(Agent):
    ...     def update(self):
    ...         for agent, distance in self.in_proximity_accuracy():
    ...             agent.freeze_movement()

    Or perhaps we simply want to change colour if there are at least two other agents nearby.

    >>> class Chameleon(Agent):
    ...     def update(self):
    ...         if self.in_proximity_accuracy().count() >= 2:
    ...             self.change_image(1)
    ...         else:
    ...             self.change_image(0)

    In some cases, we want to loop over our stream of agents multiple times.
    To make our stream reusable, we can add its agents to a list.

    >>> class TheCollector(Agent):
    ...     def update(self):
    ...         collectables = list(self.self.in_proximity_accuracy())
    ...         # do something with our collectables multiple times!
